# Recommender

These examples of recommenders for recommending products to customers based on various grounding data.

Important: Recommenders need access to the latest products available in the store. Relying on the training data in the model to only recommend relevant material will not work well as they will only recommend older products. The recommender needs to be able to access the latest products available in the store, which would need to be provided via grounding the prompt with relevant products based on a semantic index (using Embeddings).

## Recommender with customer and relevant book grounding

Improved recommendations provided based on customer interests, previous purchases and relevant books from Semantic Index. The "Similar Books" section would be pulled from a Semantic Index based on the customer's interests and previous purchases. This would be a suitable use case for Embeddings.
