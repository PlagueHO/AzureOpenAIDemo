# General practitioner referral

This document shows an example of evolution of a prompt from simple text to a more complex prompt including grounding and one-shot examples.

Goal: Improve the referral workflow of a GP practice, to automate documentation generation and delivery.
Scenario: A Dr. Jenny Jones sees a patient, 80 year old man, Fred Smith, at his practice. Fred Smith has broken his upper elbow by falling off his ebike. He wants to refer Fred to the Dr. Jones, at the Fracture Clinic in Contoso Hospital.

Inputs:
1. Medical short hand Dr. Smith creating during the visit:
```text
S: Pt c/o pain in R elbow after fall. Hx of HTN, T2DM. O: R elbow swollen, tender to palpation. ROM limited. No obvious deformity. A: Suspected R upper elbow fx. P: X-ray ordered. RICE, analgesics, sling for immobilization. Ref to Fracture Clinic.
```

1. Transcription of the patient visit:
```text
Hello Fred, how are you feeling today? I'm feeling a lot of pain in my right elbow after I fell off my ebike. Can you tell me more about the fall? I was riding my ebike and I lost my balance and fell onto my right side. Did you hit your head or lose consciousness? No, I didn't hit my head and I didn't lose consciousness. Do you have any other injuries besides your right elbow? No, just my right elbow. I see from your medical history that you have hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Yes, that's correct. And you also have rheumatoid arthritis? Yes, I do. Let me take a look at your elbow. It's swollen and tender to the touch. Can you move it at all? It's very limited in its range of motion. I don't see any obvious deformity. I suspect that you may have a fracture in your right upper elbow. I'm going to order an x-ray to confirm. In the meantime, I want you to rest, ice, compress, and elevate your elbow. I'll also prescribe some pain medication and a sling to immobilize your elbow. I'm going to refer you to the Contoso Health Fracture Clinic for further treatment. Is there anything else you need from me today? No, that's all. Thank you, Dr. Jones. You're welcome, Fred. Take care and we'll see you soon.
