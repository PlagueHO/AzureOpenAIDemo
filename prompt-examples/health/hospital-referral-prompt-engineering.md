# Hospital referral

This document shows an example of evolution of a prompt from simple text to a more complex prompt including grounding and one-shot examples.

Goal: Improve the referral workflow for a fracture clinic at a hospital to automate clinical summary on referral receipt.
Scenario: A Dr. Smith sees a patient, 80 year old man, Fred, at his practice. Fred has broken his upper elbow by falling off his ebike. Dr. Smith has referred the patient to the Fracture Clinic at Contoso Health. The Fracture Clinic has requested a clinical summary of the patient's visit combined with other relevant information from the hospitals electronic Health record. The clinical summary can be used to triage the patient and determine the urgency of the referral.

Inputs:
1. Referral request from the GP practice to Contoso Health Fracture Clinic:

Dear Fracture Clinic Team at Contoso Health,

I am writing to refer my patient, Fred Smith, for further evaluation and management of a suspected right upper elbow fracture. Mr. Smith is an 80-year-old male with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He reports an allergy to Amoxicillin and is currently taking Codeine for pain management.

Mr. Smith presented to our clinic complaining of pain in his right elbow after a fall. On examination, his right elbow was swollen and tender to palpation with limited range of motion. There was no obvious deformity. An X-ray has been ordered and he has been advised to rest, ice, compress, and elevate the affected limb, as well as to take analgesics and use a sling for immobilization.

Given his presentation and history, I suspect that Mr. Smith may have sustained a right upper elbow fracture and would benefit from further evaluation and management by your team. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any further information.

Thank you for your assistance in the care of this patient.

Sincerely,
Dr. Jenny Jones
Contoso Medical Center.
