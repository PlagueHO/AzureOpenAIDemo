### Weather report
The weather forecast for Kansas for the next three days is mostly sunny and dry, with some scattered showers and thunderstorms possible in the eastern and central parts of the state. The temperatures will range from the low 60s to the mid 80s, with moderate humidity and winds. The visibility will be good, except for some areas of fog in the early mornings and evenings.

The main weather hazards for heavy vehicle drivers in Kansas are:

- Severe thunderstorms, which can produce strong winds, hail, lightning, and heavy rain, especially in the spring and summer months. These can reduce visibility, create slippery road conditions, and damage vehicles and cargo. Drivers should monitor the weather alerts and radar, and seek shelter or avoid driving in areas under severe weather warnings. Drivers should also be aware of the risk of flash flooding, especially in low-lying or urban areas, and avoid crossing flooded roads or bridges.
- Tornadoes, which can occur any time of the year, but are most common in the spring and early summer. These can cause devastating damage and pose a serious threat to life and property. Drivers should be familiar with the signs of a tornado, such as a dark, funnel-shaped cloud, a loud roar, or flying debris, and follow the instructions of local authorities and emergency services. Drivers should never try to outrun a tornado, but instead seek shelter in a sturdy building or a low-lying ditch, and cover their head and body with a blanket or coat.
- High winds, which can occur throughout the year, but are more frequent in the fall and winter. These can create dust storms, reduce visibility, and make driving difficult and dangerous, especially for high-profile vehicles. Drivers should reduce their speed, increase their following distance, and steer firmly and smoothly. Drivers should also be alert for sudden gusts, crosswinds, and flying debris, and avoid driving near power lines, trees, or other objects that could fall or be blown onto the road. Drivers should also secure their cargo and check their tires and brakes regularly.
- Extreme temperatures, which can vary widely in Kansas, from below freezing in the winter to above 100 degrees in the summer. These can affect the performance and safety of the vehicle and the driver, as well as the quality and condition of the cargo. Drivers should check the fluid levels, battery, hoses, belts, and tires of their vehicle before and during their trip, and carry extra water, coolant, and antifreeze. Drivers should also dress appropriately, stay hydrated, and take breaks as needed. Drivers should also monitor the temperature and ventilation of their cargo, and avoid leaving it exposed to direct sunlight or extreme heat or cold.
